    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Arduino Fire Detection Project
        Project Title: Arduino-Based Fire Detection System
        
        As part of my exploration into practical applications of technology, I developed an Arduino-based fire detection system. This project aims to provide an early warning system for fire hazards, enhancing safety in various environments.
        
        Project Overview:
        
        Objective: The main goal of this project is to detect fire or smoke and alert users in real-time to prevent potential disasters.
        Components Used: I utilized an Arduino board, a flame sensor, a smoke sensor (MQ-2), a buzzer for alarms, and an LED indicator to visualize alerts.
        Key Features:
        
        Real-Time Detection: The system continuously monitors the environment for signs of fire or smoke using the sensors.
        Audible Alarm: Upon detecting fire or smoke, the buzzer emits a loud alarm to alert individuals nearby.
        Visual Indicators: An LED light changes color to indicate the status—green for safe, yellow for caution, and red for danger.
        Data Logging: The system can log detection events to monitor patterns over time (optional feature).
        Challenges and Learning: Throughout this project, I faced challenges such as calibrating the sensors for accurate readings and ensuring the system was responsive. These obstacles enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of sensor technology and electronics.
        
        Future Improvements: I plan to expand this project by integrating wireless communication, allowing alerts to be sent to mobile devices or connected smart home systems. Additionally, I hope to enhance the system with more advanced features, such as integrating temperature sensors and developing a user-friendly interface for monitoring.
        
        This fire detection project has been an exciting and educational experience, highlighting the importance of safety technology and my growing interest in IoT applications.
